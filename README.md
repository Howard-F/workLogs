# Logging Tool for Everyday Work

## Logs Data Structure

## Todo

### In Progress
* Refactor to use args as well
	- Able to make new tool that uses logger logic

* Return a message
	- Half implemented

### Not Started
* Delete function
* Can't do accents
* Company Shorthand Duplicates
* Exit out of logging without loggin
* Edit
* Close Case
	on close case, write closed case at end, with resolution
	write to archive file, create a archive pkl item and hide from output (option to show), on progress for each day, just don't show, only show case closed + reso on case close day
	on reopen, write a reopen with reason, and continue logging and unhide (basically a remove)
   Archive?  
   Reopen?
* Configs file, .ini? ex: automatically output the logs after writing,

* view log by specific id
* logger for the logger?
